# Github Actions

## Publish and Release

When starting a new Python project on GitHub, it's a good practice to follow a version management policy that adheres to semantic versioning, is automated, and makes it easy to maintain and understand the project's release history. One of the widely adopted version management policies for Python projects is using setuptools_scm with semantic versioning and Git tags.

A simple way to use GitHub Actions to build your Python package, bump the version number, and publish it to GitHub releases and PyPI.org all with a single click of a button in the web interface.
